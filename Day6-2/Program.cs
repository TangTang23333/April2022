//Practice Arrays
//1. Copying an Array
//Write code to create a copy of an array. First, start by creating an initial array. (You can use
//whatever type of data you want.) Let’s start with 10 items. Declare an array variable and
//assign it a new array with 10 items in it.Use the things we’ve discussed to put some values
//in the array.
//Now create a second array variable. Give it a new array with the same length as the first.
//Instead of using a number for this length, use the Lengthproperty to get the size of the
//original array.
//Use a loop to read values from the original array and place them in the new array.Also
//print out the contents of both arrays, to be sure everything copied correctly.
//============================================================================

//int[] nums = new int[] { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 };
//int[] newNums = new int[nums.Length];

//for (int i = 0; i < nums.Length; i++)
//{
//    newNums[i] = nums[i];
//    Console.WriteLine($"arr item: {nums[i]}, new arr item: {newNums[i]}");
//}




//2.Write a simple program that lets the user manage a list of elements.It can be a grocery list,
//"to do" list, etc.Refer to Looping Based on a Logical Expression if necessary to see how to
//implement an infinite loop. Each time through the loop, ask the user to perform an
//operation, and then show the current contents of their list. The operations available should
//be Add, Remove, and Clear. The syntax should be as follows:
//+some item
//- some item
//--
//Your program should read in the user's input and determine if it begins with a “+” or “-“ or
//if it is simply “—“ . In the first two cases, your program should add or remove the string
//given ("some item" in the example). If the user enters just “—“ then the program should
//clear the current list. Your program can start each iteration through its loop with the
//following instruction:
//Console.WriteLine("Enter command (+ item, - item, or -- to clear)):");
//=======================================================================================
//ToDo.Start();

//3.Write a method that calculates all prime numbers in given range and returns them as array
//of integers
//static int[] FindPrimesInRange(startNum, endNum)
//{
//}
//========================================================
//var res =  PrimeNumbers.FindPrimesInRange(7, 50);
//Console.WriteLine(String.Join(", ", res.ToArray()));


//4.Write a program to read an array of n integers (space separated on a single line) and an
//integer k, rotate the array right k times and sum the obtained arrays after each rotation as
//shown below.
//After r rotations the element at position I goes to position (I + r) % n.
//The sum[] array can be calculated by two nested loops: for r = 1... k; for I = 0... n - 1.
//Input Output Comments
//3 2 4 - 1 3 2 5 6 rotated1[] = -1 3 2 4
//2 rotated2[] = 4 - 1 3 2
//sum[] = 3 2 5 6
//1 2 3 4 5 12 10 8 6 9 rotated1[] = 5 1 2 3 4
//3 rotated2[] = 4 5 1 2 3
//rotated3[] = 3 4 5 1 2
//sum[] = 12 10 8 6 9
//=========================================================
//int[] nums = new int[] {3,2,4,-1};
//var res = RotationSum.Sum(2, nums);
//Console.WriteLine(String.Join(", ", res));



//5.Write a program that finds the longest sequence of equal elements in an array of integers.
//If several longest sequences exist, print the leftmost one.
//Input Output
//2 1 1 2 3 3 2 2 2 1 2 2 2
//1 1 1 2 3 1 3 3 1 1 1
//4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4
//0 1 1 5 2 2 6 3 3 1 1
//==============================================================================
//var nums = new int[] { 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2 };
//var res = LongestEqualSequence.Get(nums);
//Console.WriteLine(String.Join(", ", res));

//7.Write a program that finds the most frequent number in a given sequence of numbers.In
//case of multiple numbers with the same maximal frequency, print the leftmost of them
//Input Output
//4 1 1 4 2 3 4 4 1 2 4 9 3 The number 4 is the most frequent(occurs 5 times)
//7 7 7 0 2 2 2 0 10 10 10 The numbers 2, 7 and 10 have the same maximal
//frequence(each occurs 3 times).The leftmost of them is 7.
//================================================================================
//int[] nums = new int[] {4,1,1,4,2,3,4,4,1,2,4,9,3};
//int res = MostFrequent.Get(nums);
//Console.WriteLine(res);




//Practice Strings
//1.Write a program that reads a string from the console, reverses its letters and prints the
//result back at the console.
//Write in two ways
//Convert the string to char array, reverse it, then convert it to string again
//Print the letters of the string in back direction(from the last to the first) in a for-loop
//Input Output
//sample elpmas
//24tvcoi92 29iocvt42
//===================================================================================
//Reverse.Get1("example");
//Reverse.Get2("example");


//2.Write a program that reverses the words in a given sentence without changing the
//punctuation and spaces
//Use the following separators between the words: . , : ; = ( ) & [ ] " ' \ / ! ? (space).
//All other characters are considered part of words, e.g.C++, a + b, and a77 are
//considered valid words.
//The sentences always start by word and end by separator.
//C# is not C++, and PHP is not Delphi!
//Delphi not is PHP, and C++ not is C#!
//The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog / Yes! Really!!! /.
//Really Yes dog lazy the over jumps fox brown / quick! The!!! /.
//==============================================================================
//string s = new string("C# is, not B!");
//ReverseSentence.Get(s);

//3.Write a program that extracts from a given text all palindromes, e.g. “ABBA”, “lamal”, “exe”
//and prints them on the console on a single line, separated by comma and space.Print all
//unique palindromes(no duplicates), sorted
//Hi, exe ? ABBA! Hog fully a string: ExE.Bob
//a, ABBA, exe, ExE

//=========================================
var res = Palindrome.Get("Hi, exe ? ABBA! Hog fully a string: ExE.Bob");
Console.WriteLine(String.Join(", ", res));






//4.Write a program that parses an URL given in the following format:
//[protocol]://[server]/[resource]
//The parsing extracts its parts: protocol, server and resource.
//The [server] part is mandatory.
//The[protocol] and [resource] parts are optional.
//https://www.apple.com/iphone
//[protocol] = "https"
//[server] = "www.apple.com"
//[resource] = "iphone"
//ftp://www.example.com/employee
//[protocol] = "ftp"
//[server] = "www.example.com"
//[resource] = "employee"
//https://google.com
//[protocol] = "https"
//[server] = "google.com"
//[resource] = ""
//www.apple.com
//[protocol] = ""
//[server] = "www.apple.com"
//[resource] = ""
//Explore the following Topics
//Strings
//Arrays
//Using the StringBuilder
//Parse.Get("https://www.apple.com");
