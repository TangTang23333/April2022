5. Can you store multiple data types in System.Array?
Nope, they have to be the same data type.

but we can if object[] is created, it can store as many types as you want. object type is the root type for all types in c#.
we can use ArrayList. 

6. Whatâ€™s the difference between the System.Array.CopyTo() and System.Array.Clone()?
CloneTo creates a new shallow copy of original value/reference types in array, not the actual object of the reference type.
new reference will point to the same object like the old reference points to.


CopyTo a existing array, copy all elements from original array to an existing array starting from specified index, 
the destination array must be declared with dimension, whose dimension has to be large enough to hold the copied array. or error.
